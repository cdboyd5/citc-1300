            <h2>When did queen start?</h2>
            <p>In 1971 the members of two bands composed of university and art-school students combined to form The british rock band known as Queen. Queen released its first album called "queen" in 1973 quickly followed up buy "Queen II" in 1974
            that same year Queen hit it big internationally with the aid of Producer Roy Thomas Baker and shot up the charts with its third album "Sheer Heart Attack".
            A year later in 1955, one of pop's most expensive productions "A Night at the Opera" sold even better with the song "Bohemieon Rhapsody" being britain's top single for 9 weeks. 
             then in 1976 they released "A Day at the Races" In 1978 they released the album "News Of the world" which while not as popluar or successful as "Sheer Heart Attack" or "A Night at the Opera" introduced two hit singles in the form of "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions". 
            In the 1980 Queen released the album "The Game" which featured the songs "A Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and "Another One Bites the Dust". This album was Queen's first number one in America.
            After the release of "The Works" in 1984, Queen's popularity declined until an amazing preformance at the "Live Aid Charity Event" in 1985 rose them back up. a year later in 1986 the band released "A Kind of Magic" where it was decided that all songs written were no longer written
             by the individual band member but by Queen as a whole. The band released their final albums "Inuendo" in 1991 and in 1995 they released "Made In Heaven" after freddie had passed away. "Maid in Heaven" reached the top of the british charts. Queen was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001.
