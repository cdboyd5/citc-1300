                <h4> The Life Of Freddie Mercury</h4>
                <p>
                    Farrokh Bulsara was born in Tanzania, Zanzibar on September 5, 1946. At the age of 8 Farrokh was sent to a bording school in Bombay (now Mumbai), India,
                    Where he studied piano and spent his free time with his aunt and grandparents. Not long after that he joined his first band The Hectics. he eventually 
                    returned to Zanzibar in 1963. After a bloody revolution on the islands in 1964, Farrokh and his family fled to london where he attended the Ealing Collage
                    of Art and befriended many other musicians. he was also in his future band mates Rodger Taylor and Brian May's entourage. Five years later, Farrokh joined a 
                    group called Ibex as their lead singer and played with a few other bands before, in 1970, joining Rodger Taylor and Brian May's band "Smile" as the lead singer after the original quit.
                    Soon after, he changed the bands name to Queen and his own to Freddie Mercury. They met up with bassist John Deacon in 1971 and preformed their first gig together as Queen that june.

                <p>In addition to being a great singer and songwriter, he was also a skilled showman. He knew how to entertain and connect with audiences. he also loved to dress extravagantly- often in skintight spandex-
                    and strut around on stage, encouraging fans to join him in having fun. Freddie was also artistic and had a direct hand in designing the art for the album covers.

                    Freddie lived a lavish life. He loved to drink champain and collect art, in fact he once spent $400,000 on a set of hand painted china. He was also a party animal.
                    He would throw elaborate celebrations for whatever occasion; an example of this is that for a birthday party he flew a group of friends to the island of Ibiza where the celebrated with fireworks and flaminco dancing.

                    By 1989 Freddie retreated from public life. He did not premote or tour for Queens next album "Innuendo"(1991) and rumors about his health started to circulate.

                    After Innuendo was released, he spent the next eleven months after the release of Innuendo working with Queen on their last album "Made in heaven" before dying on November 24th, 1991.
