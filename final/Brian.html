                <h2>The Life of Brian May</h2>
                <p>
                    Brian Harold May was born in Hampton, Middlesex, England, to his parents Ruth and Harold May on July 19th, 1947. May attended the local Hanworth Road state primary school, and at the age of 11 won a scholarship to "The Hampton Grammer School"( now called The Hampton School).
                    During his time at Hamton Grammer School, Brian and his father built a custom guitar using whatever they could get their hands on, like firewood. It was compleated when he graduated in 1965. After his graduation, he would enroll into the astrophysics program at "London Imperial Collage".
                    While at collage Brian would form a band called "Smile" and soon found his love of music trumped his intrest in astrophysics. In 1971 Brian put off compleating his PH.D. to hit the road with his band, which was soon renamed "Queen". In 2007 he compleated his PH.D.
