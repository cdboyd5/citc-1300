                <p>
                    Roger Meddows Taylor was born to parents Michael and Winfred Taylor, on July 26, 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk. He lived in King's Lynn and went to school at Rosebury avenue school. Him and his family
                    moved to Truro, Cornwall. When he was seven years old he formed his first band with some of his friends called "The Bubblingover Boys", where he played the Ukulele. After briefly atending Truro Cathedral School, he joined Truro 
                    school as a day boy at the age of 13. when he was 15 he joined the band "Reaction" a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. In 1967 he went to study dentestry at the London Hospital Medical Collage, but
                    he eventually became bored with it, transfered to East London Polytechnic and obtained a BSc in biology. in 1968 Roger met Brian may and Tim Staffel after a friend saw an advertisement at Imperial Collage that "Smile" needed a new drummer.
                    Smile lasted for two years before Staffel left. In 1970 Smile Broke up but Freddie Convinced the remaining members of smile to continue, eventually joined them, and changed the band's name to Queen. The rest is history.
