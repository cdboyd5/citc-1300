                <h2>The Life of John Deacon</h2>
                <p>
                    On August, 19th 1951, in Liecester, England, John Richard Deacon was born to parents Artur Henry and Lilian Mollie Deacon. They moved to the small town of Oadby in 1960. He developed a passion for electronics while also taking up music, having been influenced by the Beatles.
                    In 1965, at the age of 14 John joined a school band called "The Opposition" where he started out as the guitarest, but eventually switched to playing the bass along with the band's name change to "The New Opposition." He eventually left "The Art"(the name changed again) in 1969,
                     because he had been accepted into Chelsea Collage in London (now part of King's Collage london). After less than a year of studying in london, John wanted to join a band despite the fact that he left his bass and amplifier at home in Oadby.
                    Deacon saw the newly formed Queen of october that year, but was not impressed. later on in the year, he briefly formed a band called "Deacon" that made one live appearance at Chelsea Collage. In early 1971, John was invited to a disco where his friend introduced him to Roger Taylor and Brian May who were in need of a bassist.
                    After a few days, John showed up to the audition at a lecture room at Imperial Collage London and became the final member to join Queen, as well as the youngest member. He played his first show with Queen at the Collage of Estate Management in kingston in june. Sometime during the year, he obtained a First Class Honours degree in Electronics.
                    When Queen's first album was released in 1973 and he was credited as "Deacon John", in order to make him "sound more interesting". After the first album he asked to be credited under his real name, which was done on all other albums released.
                    Deacon's first writing credit came on Queen's Third album, where he wrote the song "Misfire" in which he played almost all guitar parts. He also played some guide guitar parts on the album due to the fact may was hospitalized with hepatitis when recording started. The second song he wrote "Your My Best Friend", written for his wife-to-be Veronica, was featured on Queen's 4th album and went on to be an international hit.
                    After this happend, he tended to write one or two songs for every Queen album. In 1980, John wrote the hit "Another One Bites The Dust" as a dance song based on his early love of soul music. Deacon would collaborate with Freddie through the early 1980s, helping push the band towards a lighter disco sound. His collaboration with Freddie would come to a climax with the release of Queen's 1982 album "Hot Space", which failed.
                    Freddie's Death in november 1991 upset John so much that it resulted in a significant reduction in his musical activities. In an interview with the Bassist magazine in April 1996 He said, "As far as we are concerned, this is it. There is no point carrying on. It is impossible to replace Freddie." He played with Queen three more times those times were at "The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for Aids Awarness" on april 20th, 1992, at the Cowdray house in Midhurston for a charity event with Rodger Taylor on september 18th, 1993, and at the opening of the Bejart Ballet in Paris on 17 January 1997, performing only "The Show Must Go On" with Elton John on lead vocals. Afterwords, he retired from music.
                    He Reapeared briefly in October 1997 for the recording of the final Queen song "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)", included on the Queen Rocks album released a month later.
